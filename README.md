A C++ library with some common and basic functionalities to use in any C++ project.
It contains the following utilities :
- CommandLineManager : a class to manage command line arguments with a linux style syntax
- ConfigurationParser/Object : Classes to manage configuration files, with parsing.
- FileTools : Utility class to read/write/check data to and from the filesystem.

- PathTools : Utility class for common operations on paths
- Base64 : Utility class to encode/decode from Base64 strings

It also contains other utilities that are not listed here because they either are not complete, or
don't really belong in this library and will be moved to another one in the future.
